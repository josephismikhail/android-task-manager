# Task Management App (Successorator)

A productivity app built in **Android Studio (Java)** that allows users to add, remove, and reorder daily tasks.  
The app promotes productivity by breaking down broad goals into simple, actionable items.

## My Contributions
- Implemented **instrumented tests** with **JUnit 4** and **AndroidX Test** to validate repository and ViewModel workflows  
- Wrote **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** scenarios to ensure recurring tasks, rollovers, and contextual task management worked as expected  
- Used a **Room in-memory database** and **mockable time/data sources** for reliable, deterministic testing  
- Led QA efforts to improve app reliability across Android versions and screen sizes

## Tech Stack
- **Language & IDE**: Java, Android Studio  
- **Testing**: JUnit 4, AndroidX Test  
- **Database**: Room (with in-memory testing)

## Class Notes / Iteration Logs  
*(Original course documentation preserved for reference)*  

### MS2 Iteration 1
- **Estimated Velocity:** 0.65  
- **Estimated Work Completed:** 15 hours  
- **Actual Hours Needed:** 30 hours  
- **User Stories Addressed:**  
  - US1: Recurring Tasks  
  - US1-1: Refactor Date  
  - US1-2: Recurring Functionality  
  - US1-3: Update Create Task Dialog  

**Iteration Analysis:**  
Progress was slowed by the complexity of US1-2 (Recurring Functionality), which delayed dependent tasks. Additional time was needed for debugging and office hours. Plans for Iteration 2 adjusted accordingly.

### MS2 Iteration 2 Planning
- **Predicted Velocity:** 0.6  
- **Justification:** With US1-2 completed, the team expected smoother progress and the ability to address more tasks in the next iteration.
