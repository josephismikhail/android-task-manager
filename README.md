# Team 5 - Successorator 

---

Successorator is a "success list" app that assists users in planning out their day by breaking down broad and oftentimes ambiguous goals into simple and digestible tasks to promote productivity in daily life.

MS2 Iteration 1:

Estimated Velocity: 0.65
Estimated Work Completed: 15 hours
Actual Hours Needed: 30 hours
User Stories + Tasks Addressed:
- US1: Recurring Tasks
  US1-1: Refactor Date
  US1-2: Recurring Functionality
  US1-3: Update Create Task Dialog
I1 Velocity: 15/30 = 0.5

Analysis of Iteration 1:
- Iteration 1 progress was unideal, primarily because of the difficulty of US1-2: Recurring Functionality. We ran into issues with implementation, which pushed back our agenda for other tasks and user stories given that many of them relied on US1-2 to be completed. We purposefully high-balled the estimated hours for US1-2 to be 12 hours during the MS2 Planning Phase, but we still required additional time to attend office hours and fix multiple bugs among other things. We adjusted our plan for Iteration 2 to take on US2 and US3, which worked out nicely given that the estimated work hours for Iteration 2 were fairly low to account for such situations where we needed to roll over tasks/user stories.

MS2 Iteration 2 Planning:

Predicted Velocity: 0.6
Justification: MS2 Iteration 1 velocity was calculated to be 0.5. We anticipated our new velocity to be larger because with the US1-2 task finished, our team will be able to work on significantly more tasks that originally relied on the correct implementation of US1-2.
