# Task Management App (Successorator)

A productivity app built in **Android Studio (Java)**.
This app will function as a TO-DO list for a user. They will be able to add goals to a list that will rollover to the next day if not completed. They can tap on any goal to mark it as finished so it is moved to the bottom of the list. The app also supports recurring goals, context setting, and different views.

## My Contributions
- Implemented **instrumented tests** with **JUnit 4** and **AndroidX Test** to validate repository and ViewModel workflows  
- Wrote **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** scenarios to ensure recurring tasks, rollovers, and contextual task management worked as expected  
- Used a **Room in-memory database** and **mockable time/data sources** for reliable, deterministic testing  
- Led QA efforts to improve app reliability across Android versions and screen sizes

## Class Notes / Iteration Logs  
*(Original course documentation preserved for reference)*  

### MS2 Iteration 1
- **Estimated Velocity:** 0.65  
- **Estimated Work Completed:** 15 hours  
- **Actual Hours Needed:** 30 hours  
- **User Stories Addressed:**  
  - US1: Recurring Tasks  
  - US1-1: Refactor Date  
  - US1-2: Recurring Functionality  
  - US1-3: Update Create Task Dialog  

**Iteration Analysis:**  
Progress was slowed by the complexity of US1-2 (Recurring Functionality), which delayed dependent tasks. Additional time was needed for debugging and office hours. Plans for Iteration 2 adjusted accordingly.

---

### MS2 Iteration 2 Planning
- **Predicted Velocity:** 0.6  
- **Justification:** With US1-2 completed, the team expected smoother progress and the ability to address more tasks in the next iteration.
